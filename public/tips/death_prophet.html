		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Krobe will walk to wherever you cast Crypt Swarm if it's not within 600 range even though she can hit
				units 1100 range away. Keep this in mind during chases or pushes.</li>
			<li>Crypt Swarm can use unit targeting or ground targeting. If an enemy is juking into fog, use ground
				targeting, otherwise Death Prophet may cancel the unit-targeted cast if the enemy escapes vision.</li>
			<li>You can't use two Siphon charges on one enemy at the same time, but you can have more than one Siphon out.
				If you're getting ganked, try to Siphon all of the heroes chasing you, or neutral/enemy creeps for the HP.</li>
			<li>Exorcism ghosts deal physical damage. As a result, it goes through BKB, does more/less damage based on
				armor values and is generally relevant all game long.</li>
			<li>Your Ghosts will target whoever you right click. You can change targets even if you're
				disabled/stunned/Chronosphered/Cycloned.</li>
			<li>When pushing undefended towers, stand closer to the tower. This will decrease the amount of time your
				ghosts spend circling back to you after hitting the structure and allow you to deal more damage.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Chasing her down mid-Exorcism is a dangerous game. Besides the fact that the ghosts do a lot of damage,
				it's entirely likely that the ghosts will completely fill up her HP once they're done and she'll just
				turn around and destroy you.</li>
