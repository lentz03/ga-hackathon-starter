		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Whirling Death can be activated while you're mid-Timber Chain.</li>
			<li>Remember that Whirling Death only deals pure damage if it cuts a tree down during the cast.</li>
			<li>Be generous when targeting Timber Chain. It's okay to sacrifice ~50 range to ensure you aren't
				airballing chains.</li>
			<li>Your goal in lane is to find the minimum amount of creep aggro you need to draw to keep Reactive Armor
				working at its cap.</li>
			<li>Go into the jungle and tank a few neutrals to build up Reactive Armor stacks before a gank/dive.</li>
			<li>An enemy can receive the burst damage from the Chakram once when it flies out and once when it's coming
				back. So if it looks like an enemy is about to escape the AoE of the Chakram, just return it while
				they're still in it. The extra passthrough damage will be more useful than a few more milliseconds of
				slow.</li>
			<li>Learn the trees on the map. There are many unique juke paths that only Timber can take advantage of
				thanks to his skill set.</li>
			<li>When escaping late game, try carving out paths with Chakram before Timber Chaining. Timber Chaining into
				a deforested area could buy you a few seconds of fog.</li>
			<li>If you're building a Bloodstone and you already have Arcane Boots, don't buy another Arcane Orb for the
				Soul Booster, just disassemble your Arcanes.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't stand next to trees when laning against or escaping from Timber. The distance you're saving by
				hugging the treeline won't matter when he purely damages your ass.</li>
			<li>Timbersaw hates being silenced, especially if he has a Chakram out because that means he literally can't
				do anything.</li>
			<li>Chakram has a fairly slow travel time, so it's usually worth sacrificing some positioning if it means
				you can evade the slow when he's chasing you.</li>
			<li>You can disable Timbersaw mid-Chain to stop him from moving. If your team has a shortage of stuns, save them
				for when you see his chain comes out. That way Chain goes on cooldown, but he won't go anywhere.</li>
			<li>Avoid right click harassing him in lane. That's what he wants. Save your mana and HP for a full kill
				attempt or just harass him with magic damage.</li>
			<li>If you're a strength hero, Whirling Death's primary attribute loss debuff willÂ eat you for breakfast.
				Most STR heroes have ~35 strength at level 4 with no items, meaning that you'll lose ~100 HP in addition
				to the nuke damage.</li>
