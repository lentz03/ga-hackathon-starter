		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>There's a cast time on Shadow Strike, so stop-cancel it to bait out defensive spells from enemies.</li>
			<li>Only Blink to initiate if you're absolutely positive that the enemies can't take a fight when you show
				up. If it turns out that Lion had just enough mana for a Hex and now Ursa is TPing in, that 6s cooldown
				is going to feel like an eternity.</li>
			<li>Scream of Pain can hit invis units and units in fog.</li>
			<li>Sonic Wave can kill couriers.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Shadow Strike is not a constant DoT. There's an initial nuke damage when the projectile hits and then a
				tick of damage every 3 seconds (5 ticks, for 15 seconds). Get a quick Bottle sip or Armlet toggle
				between ticks to stay alive.</li>
			<li>You need a minimum of ﻿８  ０  ０  ０  Ｍ  Ａ  Ｔ  Ｃ  Ｈ  Ｍ  Ａ  Ｋ  Ｉ  Ｎ  Ｇ  Ｐ  Ｏ  Ｉ  Ｎ  Ｔ  Ｓ to
				pull this one off. Shadow Strike's DoT times are the same as Blink Dagger's break cooldown. So if you're
				crazy, you can drop your Dagger on the map right before a tick hits and then pick it back up unbroken.</li>
			<li>Shadow Strike's projectile can be completely disjointed by invisibility.</li>
			<li>Watch her Blink animation to determine the direction that she Blinks in. The particle 'cone' always
				points in the direction that she goes.</li>
			<li>QoP can be built in a number of ways which will influence how she will be played. If you're seeing an
				Oblivion Staff or Mystic Staff, watch for ganks because she's probably going Orchid or Sheep, if you're
				seeing a Point Booster, watch for team fights because she's probably going Agh or Bloodstone, if you're
				seeing an Ogre Club or Perseverance, she's probably going BKB or Linken's and is probably going to
				semi-carry.</li>
