		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Eclipse is married to Lucent Beam. If for some reason you're keeping Lucent Beam at low levels, Eclipse
				is going to be useless.</li>
			<li>Eclipse doesn't continue after you die, so don't use it if you're getting ganked just because you're
				angry that you got caught.</li>
			<li>Eclipse has a fairly long cast time. It's okay to cast it earlier than you need it just so you can get
				it off before getting perma-stunned.</li>
			<li>Eclipse turns the map to night for 10 seconds. If you see a bunch of enemies moments away from ganking
				you and you really don't want to die, you can use Eclipse's night to potentially hide yourself from
				enemy vision.</li>
			<li>You're not getting a Helm of the Dominator for the lifesteal, you're getting it so you can take a creep,
				send it to stack the ancients four times, and walk out a minute later with six hundred gold and two
				levels.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Luna has one of the highest base move speeds in the game, so as tempting as it can be to dive her in the
				early game, it can be risky without disables.</li>
			<li>Luna has 1800 vision at night once she levels Lunar Blessing, so you need to be sneaky if you're trying
				to gank her at night.</li>
			<li>Once your tier 3 tower goes down, get ready to enter Glaive City. Not only will this damage everything
				in sight but there is a high probability that your Blink Dagger is going to get disabled from an errant
				Glaive. Stand as far as possible from your structures if you're planning on blink initiating.</li>
