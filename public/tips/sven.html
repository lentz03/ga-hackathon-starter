		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Storm Hammer is arguably the best level one stun in the game. The caveat is that you'll only have the
				mana for one stun every five minutes because of how mana hungry the spell is and how terrible Sven's INT
				gain is. Pretty much every time you drop the Hammer during the laning phase, it needs to end up in a
				kill.</li>
			<li>Warcry is a very potent pushing skill. The armor buff applies to all allied units in the AoE, including
				summons. Even if you're not pushing, you can use it on your creep wave as it passes the river to get
				some extra tower damage or to make it harder for the enemy to last hit.</li>
			<li>Warcry is a very potent chasing skill. The 12% move speed buff is almost another pair of brown Boots'
				worth of MS. Take a level of this early on.</li>
			<li>Warcry is a very potent team fighting skill. When maxed, you're giving an Assault Cuirass's's's worth of
				armor to everyone on your team for 7 seconds.</li>
			<li>God's Strength multiplies Sven's primary attribute damage. Meaning, when you go full WOLOLO, your STR is
				getting multiplied, but items that are adding green + damage (raw damage items) aren't get multiplied.</li>
			<li>Sven is the only hero on whom BKB is truly <i>core</i> core. On nearly every other hero, BKB is
				primarily bought a defensive item, but because God's Strength jacks Sven up from his STR, BKB is a
				ridiculously strong offensive item on him, giving +44/49/54 damage at 6/11/16. This is the same reason
				why Heart is actually a very strong damage item on Sven (+80/100/120 dmg).</li>
			<li>BKB is also necessary to serve as the can opener for the whoop ass you deliver with God's Strength. Time
				spent disabled is time spent not smashing everything in your path.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can disjoint Storm Hammer. If the primary target of the stun disjoints it, nothing in the AoE will
				get stunned.</li>
			<li>Sven relies on being able to kill you before you kill him. He's a STR hero, but he's often built like a
				plexiglass cannon. In team fights, he should pretty much always be the top priority if he's the carry.</li>
