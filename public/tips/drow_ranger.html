		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Drow not only has stupid long attack range, but she also has an orb effect. Abuse this in lane. If
				you're not able to get last hits because her animation blows, at least make life annoying for whoever is
				in your lane.</li>
			<li>Don't forget to turn off Frost Arrows if you have Lifesteal. The orbs don't stack.</li>
			<li>The knockback on Gust doesn't break channels, so don't bother using it to cancel a TP.</li>
			<li>However, the knockback does move enemies, making it cancel Templar Assassin's Meld and Shadow Amulet.</li>
			<li>You have to activate Precision Aura if you want ranged summons like Visage's Familiars or
				Enigma's Eidolons to benefit from the Aura.</li>
			<li>Post-Agh, all split arrows will have whatever on-hit effects the main arrow has. All 3 arrows will independently roll for crit/bash/lightning and all 3 arrows will have the Skadi/Deso/lifesteal effect.
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Get in her face. There is nothing Drows hate more than someone in melee range of her. If a hero is within
				400 range of her, she loses the agility bonus from Marksmanship, so try closing the distance even if you're
				a ranged hero.</li>
