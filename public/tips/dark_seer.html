		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Vacuum destroys trees in a small AoE. Use this against enemies who like blinking/hiding in the trees.</li>
			<li>When the two creep waves meet during the laning phase, watch for which of the enemy melee creeps is
				taking the least damage and then Ion Shell that one. Now the enemies can't kill the Shelled creep on
				demand.</li>
			<li>In the laning phase, if the enemy has spells that quickly kill creeps, cast Ion Shell on enemy creeps instead.</li>
			<li>For some reason you can cast Ion Shell on enemy heroes. The main use for this would be casting it on
				enemy melee heroes during tower defenses They'll either kill their whole creep wave or they'll have to
				back off attacking the tower.</li>
			<li>Don't put Ion Shells on frontline creeps. You want to put it on the 2nd/3rd creep in the wave whenever
				you're pushing or farming. The first creep in the wave is going to take the most damage from the enemy
				wave and will die first.</li>
			<li>Ion Shelling invisible allies is hilarious. The damage isn't large enough to show a huge white bar of
				missing HP building up on an unsuspecting enemy and the purple lines emitting from the shell don't even
				appear.</li>
			<li>75% of the time, your allies will benefit from a Surge more than you can. Don't be a scrooge. Surge and
				Shell that Radiance+Scorched Earth Doom and watch him turn into a 522 MS Epicenter. Help Crystal Maiden
				put that ward down without being molested for once. Let Batrider take someone halfway across the map in
				three seconds.</li>
			<li>You can Surge the courier.</li>
			<li>A Wall of Replica across the top of the stairs on a tier 3 tower can instantly discourage a push. I know
				it feels bad that you won't be able to make copies if the enemy decide to not push, but if you know that
				you're not going to get good positioning or a good Vacuum, it can be worth it.</li>
			<li>Micro the illusions generated by Wall of Replica. I don't know what their default command is when
				they're created, but I'm guessing it's something along the lines of: "Attack useless things." As soon as
				you score a good Vacuum+Wall, order all the units to attack the highest priority target on the enemy
				team or get them to bully a support out of a fight.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If Seer is solo versus two of you, the support should just sit on his side of the lane very early on.
				The more you can zone him out early, the better since once he gets a few levels into Ion Shell you won't
				be able to trade hits with him. Wait for him to Shell a creep, then immediately pop out and start poking
				his pointy butt.</li>
			<li>Ion Shell is purgeable, making Oracle with Fortune's End a very strong lane counter to DS.</li>
			<li>When trying to kill Seer, try to save stuns and disables for AFTER he casts Surge.</li>
			<li>You can purge Surge. This includes purges from Diffusal Blade or purges from Cyclones (Eul's or
				Invoker's).</li>
			<li>Every time the Wall makes an illusion of you, you'll take the nuke damage from the Wall again. So stop
				standing in the wall to kill them, you round headed schmuck.</li>
			<li>If you're a carry, pay attention to when an illusion is made of you. While you're critting their team
				for buckets o' damage, your Bizarro counterpart is doing the same to your supports. Do your team a favor
				and kill your illusion before it zones them out.</li>
			<li>If you have a Radiance, consider toggling it off if you anticipate enemy initiation for a team fight.
				After you pass through DS's Wall, you can turn it back on.</li>
