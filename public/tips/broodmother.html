		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Always be checking your enemy's items. If they're sitting around with a single sentry ward, you can be
				sure that they know where you are and they're waiting for the right moment to pounce.</li>
			<li>Always be checking your enemy's mana. If they've been blowing spells left and right to try to farm your
				spiders, they're leaving themselves vulnerable for an easy kill.</li>
			<li>You get Spiderites on Spiderling denies (or creep denies). Heck, you don't even need to get the deny,
				just poke every allied creep with a Spiderling and have them die within 2 seconds. Boom, free
				Spiderites. That's another second of sweet, sweet tower sieging.</li>
			<li>If an enemy is on top of your web and you want to kill them with spiders, try giving all your spiders a
				move/follow command on the enemy hero first. They'll seamlessly stack on the enemy and their first
				attack will deal a ton of damage before the enemy has a chance to react.</li>
			<li>In lane, time your spider harass with enemy last hits. They'll either stay still to get the last hit
				letting your spiders get free hits in or they'll run off and miss the last hit.</li>
			<li>Spiders can also be used to block or stack camps. If you're farming in the lane send some Spiders to the
				nearby jungle camps that you know you're going to farm or stack them.</li>
			<li>Spiders are also useful for cutting off creeps. Send a pile of spiders behind an enemy tower and mess
				with the creep equilibrium by luring them into the jungle.</li>
			<li>Spiderlings and Spiderites have nearly the same vision radius as a hero. If you're freefarming your legs
				off send a lone spider to chill somewhere up ahead to scout.</li>
			<li>Webs have a global cast range as long as the new one you're casting is touching an old one.</li>
			<li>Manta Style is a worthwhile early pickup on Brood. You can Manta out of Dust, your Illusions get
				Incapacitating Bite, and the move speed bonus from webs can be used by illusions (illusions don't get
				the free pathing, however).</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't sit around with one sentry in your inventory. Either quickly place both down or drop the extra
				somewhere near your tower. An ignorant Broodmother is pretty much a free kill in the early game, so
				don't squander your opportunity.Â Don't pull the ripcord too quickly or take too long. If her creep wave
				just died you can be sure that your creeps are going to start hitting her in her web and will completely
				give the jig up. Similarly, don't just throw down a sentry and then start auto attacking her wildly.</li>
			<li>Try to sneak up with your AoE spells. Broodmothers will immediately call their spiders off as soon as
				they see Lina float into their lane. Cast something like Illuminate from the fog, however, and you'll be
				making that paper.</li>
			<li>Get a Stout Shield/Poor Man's Shield to negate a lot of Spiderling/ite damage. Even as a ranged hero it
				can be worth it.</li>
			<li>Some heroes that Brood hates going up against: <b>Axe</b> (hard to kill in lane, makes life difficult
				when pushing with Blink+Call), <b>Bristleback</b> (Quill Spray immediately removes free pathing from all
				Brood's spiders and he's hard to kill), <b>Centaur Warrunner</b> (Return breaks free pathing without him
				even trying), <b>Dark Seer</b> (Ion Shell is irritating to deal with and he has high armor), <b>Legion
				Commander</b> (Overwhelming Odds obliterates Brood's entire army from a mile away and she'll have a chance
				to proc Moment of Courage off every spider), <b>Storm Spirit</b> (has high natural armor and Remnant is cheap
				enough to spam against spiders), <b>Tidehunter</b> (Anchor Smash is tough to deal with and he's crazy
				tanky), <b>Timbersaw</b> (difficult to kill with Reactive Armor, has tons of AoE to kill spiders).</li>
			<li><i>Not</i> Earthshaker. No, I'm sorry, but Shaker is an awful counter to Brood unless the enemy Brood is
				awful, in which case you don't need to counterpick her. By the time Shaker is able to farm a Blink,
				you've probably already lost every tower worth defending. You'll note that all the counters I mentioned
				counter her in lane. Shaker does nothing against a Brood during the laning phase.</li>
