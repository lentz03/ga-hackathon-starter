		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Nyx gets the luxury of easy positioning that Lion doesn't get, making multi hero Impales much simpler.
				Vendetta one hero and then roughly target the Impale on the other hero. Since you're in such close range
				to your first target, you will most likely nyx them both with the Impale.</li>
			<li>Mana Burn does more raw damage on INT heroes, but mana is a much more expensive resource on STR and AGI
				heroes. Nyx wisely.</li>
			<li>You can cast Spiked Carapace while in Vendetta and the invis won't be removed. Try to Nyx yourself into
				enemy AoE spells while in Vendetta to get an easy setup for your combo.</li>
			<li>Use Vendetta for the damage mid game, but use it to get a good stun late game. The nuke is still useful,
				but people will have BKBs and be grouped up late game, making it a lot harder to fully nyx someone
				without getting stopped.</li>
			<li>At level 16 Vendetta's cooldown is less than the duration. Try to make things happen during the tail end
				of the duration so that you can Vendetta out if things go poorly or to get a double Vendetta for maximum
				nyxing.</li>
			<li>Oh boy, a hero where Dagon is core! That's great. Upgrading it to Dagon 5 is not core. Unless you're
				straight up nyxin' outta control, you should probably work on a late game item or a Blink Dagger after
				Dagon 1/2.</li>
			<li>Be on the map as little as possible. The less time you spend nyxing around in lane, the less willing the
				enemies are to farm.</li>
			<li>You can cast Vendetta while you're channeling a TP. Nyx.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Be aware of your damage sources. Nyx can Carapace stun you off of things like Radiance burn or any DoT
				you put on him.</li>
			<li>Resist the urge to retaliate whenever he blows his full combo on you. Nyxes almost always Carapace as
				soon as they finish their sequence. Just walk away. Be the bigger man. Don't stun/kill yourself.</li>
			<li>Try to bait out Carapace by casting and canceling spells with obvious animations (Split Earth, Thunder
				Clap, Shockwave, etc).</li>
			<li>While Burrowed, Nyx still 'faces' a direction. Chances are he's facing towards your team since he's casting
				spells in that direction. You can take him by surprise by Force Staffing his mound into your team.</li>
