		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you're offlaning, you can use your Axes to cut down the treeline next to you to improve your vision.</li>
			<li>Since Wild Axes deal physical damage, you can use them to damage ancients.</li>
			<li>For some reason, the Boar does not draw aggro from creeps. This means that you can have the Boar spit at
				an enemy hero all day and they'll have to kill it themselves.</li>
			<li>If you have a Blink Dagger and you're chasing someone, wait to summon your Boar until after you Blink.</li>
			<li>This guy is the king of counterwarding with the hawk for vision and the boar for ranged attacks. If you
				get sentry wards, gem, or if you really want to impress everyone, a Necro 3, prepare to rob the enemy
				team of all their vision with your mobile dewarding crew.</li>
			<li>Try to aim Primal Roar like a Burrowstrike if possible. You'll only be able to stun your primary target,
				but any enemies caught in the line of fire will be slowed and take damage.</li>
			<li>Additionally, Primal Roar's knockback is the only spell in the game that applies forced movement on
				enemies but <i>doesn't</i> break trees. With clever positioning,
				<a target="_blank" href="http://a.pomf.cat/fxwetn.webm">you can use this to trap enemies in trees.</a></li>
			<li>Primal Roar can be used to stun couriers.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Take the time to kill the Hawk if you see it. Use a spell if you have to, the hawk isn't spell immune.
				Half the reason this guy gets picked is because of the vision he gives his team. If you suspect that the
				Hawk is already invis and you are in the mood for privacy, toss an AoE spell like Powershot or Dragon
				Slave on top of the nearest bunch of trees. You might inadvertently 360 noscope kill it.</li>
			<li>Take the time to kill the Boar in lane. Use spells on it if you have to. The Boar is what makes Beastmaster
				an incredibly strong laner and the cooldown is fairly long. Kill it as soon as he summons it and he'll
				be far less aggressive.</li>
