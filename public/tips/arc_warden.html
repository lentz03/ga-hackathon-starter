    <h1>Tips</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Flux fully stacks with itself. Assuming neither cast gets muted, that's 780 magic damage over 6 seconds.</li>
      <li>Manipulate creep aggro to get good Fluxes in lane. The search radius for muting Flux is 225, which is pretty small.
        Right click an enemy hero to attract their creeps towards you and then Flux 'em. Just don't forget to kill their
        ranged creep first.</li>
      <li>Enemies can't see the AoE of Spark Wraiths if the Wraith itself is in fog. Plant Wraiths on cliffs or in trees.</li>
      <li>Spark Wraiths trigger on invis <i>and</i> Smoked units.</li>
      <li>You don't need to fully envelope a tower to give it the bonus attack speed and evasion. Place the bubble in a way
        that just barely skims the back of the tower so enemies can't easily stand in it and bypass the evasion.</li>
      <li>At Necro 3, both the Archer and the Warrior give 200 gold each and 200 experience each. If those numbers mean
        nothing to you, know that Midasing the big creep in a hard camp gives ~300 exp. So while you're turbo leveling with
        the Double's Midas, you're also handing the enemy a ton of experience every time you kamikaze your Doubled Necro creeps.</li>
      <li>However, if Necro creeps time out they won't give any experience (this is true for all summons).</li>
      <li>Interactions with various items on the Double:
        <ul>
        <li>Items with charges (Urn, Diffusal, Drum, Tango, Bottle, TP, BKB's CD, etc.) copy the Original's charges.</li>
        <li>Doubles cannot copy Aegis, Cheese, Courier, Wards, Tome, Gem, Rapier, or Smoke. It <i>can</i> copy Refresher, but
          it can't activate it.</li>
        <li>A Double dying with a Bloodstone won't heal allies.</li>
        <li>Doubles cannot pick up or Bottle runes. If you have a rune Bottled, it'll just have a full bottle on cast.</li>
        <li>Doubles cannot pick up or drop items.</li>
        </ul>
      <li>So what can you do with items?
        <ul>
        <li>It's almost always worth spending a slot on your hero with some sort of regen consumable. Salve, Mango, Bottle with at
          least 1 charge. Let your Double nourish you.</li>
        <li>Midas is considered core since the item effectively has a 2x multiplier on Zet. Once you hit 16 (or earlier) you should
          probably avoid spamming Double for the Midas and save it for a fight/objective.</li>
        <li>Double Shivas' is basically 400 magic damage in a 900 radius. The slow and aura don't stack, however.</li>
        <li>As stated earlier, double Necrobooks is/was a very common build on Zet.</li>
        <li>Manta can be a safer and more versatile pushing/DPS build. Remember, he's an AGI hero and You+Double+Four illusions under
          two Magnetic Fields can dole out some serious damage.</li>
        <li>In 6.87, the stack duration for Pipe of Insight's Barrier was removed, meaning your team can benefit from the Pipe active as
          often as you have the item available. Then again I'd only recommend building Pipe on Arc if you're against a Zeus, Sand King,
          Leshrac, KotL, Tinker team or something.</li>
        <li>Interestingly, Mek has a 25 second stack limit duration against its 65 second cooldown. I... I don't think MekZet is a good
          idea yet, but I am intrigued.</li>
        <li>A double Dagon 5 can deal 1600 magic damage from 800 range. It can also be completely nullified by someone building BKB.</li>
        <li>The debuff from Medallion/Solar Crest does <i>not</i> stack if cast on the same enemy, but it's still an item worth
          considering.</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>
    <h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
        <li>For the love of god, please stand next to an ally if they're Fluxed and you're nearby. Arc Warden is pretty much 99% single
          target damage. If you jump into the mix to save an ally he's probably not going to even touch you. This is highly relevant when
          going for runes.</li>
        <li>Flux can be muted by standing next to neutral creeps.</li>
        <li>MKB won't help you hit buildings affected by Magnetic Field.</li>
        <li>Magnetic Field won't provide any evasion to enemies (heroes or buildings) if you're attacking from inside the Field.</li>
        <li>Spark Wraiths cannot be disjointed. Think of it like Skywrath's Arcane Bolt since it also provides vision as it travels towards you.</li>
        <li>Once he gets Tempest Double up and running with Midas, Zet will be spending a lot of his time cycling around neutral camps while his Double
          pushes lanes. It's a running joke, but warding his jungle really is one of the best ways to slow down Arc Warden. Find him and kill him,
          block his camps, or just take his jungle over and hem him out.</li>
        <li>You really need AoE damage to deal with the way most Arc Warden's build. Zet's all about tossing expendable bodies at your structures
          until you lose. If you donâ€™t have any good AoE spells, consider building items like Maelstrom/Mjollnir, Battle Fury, Radiance, Veil, or
          Shiva's Guard to deal with the onslaught.</li>
        <li>Spells treat the Double like a hero, not like an illusion. Except for interactions that occur when a hero dies, like Bloodstone or Track
          or Duel. Those spells treat the Double like an illusion. Unless the Double <i>wins</i> a Duel. Then it actually can use the bonus damage.
          Unlike an illusion. Hoo boy.</li>
				<li>Slark can Essence Shift and OD can INT steal from the Double.</li>
        <li>Rubick can steal Tempest Double and Rubick's Double can use Spell Steal as well.</li>
    </ul>
