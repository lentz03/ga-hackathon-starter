		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Every attribute is harder, better, faster, and stronger in melee form. Typically the only reasons you
				should be in ranged form after the laning phase is to cast the Whirling Axes slow, get hits on an enemy
				if you're blocked out by Fissure or Cogs or something, or get one very last hit on an enemy before they
				escape.</li>
			<li>Troll is the dumbest hero in the game with +1 INT growth per level. Whirling Axes (Melee) is a great wave
				clearing spell, but Troll runs out of magic juice fast, especially if you got a Shadow Blade or other
				mana-requiring items, so be careful about spamming and don't build % mana-regen items.</li>
			<li>Neither the blind, nor the damage, from Whirling Axes (Melee) work on Rosh.</li>
			<li>Pay attention to when you can help your team with Battle Trance if you're not around.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Troll's no Ursa, but he can still solo Rosh fairly early in the game. Keep your eyes on the pit after he
				picks up some lifesteal.</li>
			<li>The blind on Whirling Axes (Melee) is obnoxious and usually worth getting a King Bar for. It also means
				that you need to be very careful when ganking him if you don't have a lot of magic burst.</li>
			<li>Troll's entire kit revolves around making chop suey out of a single target. If he has to switch focus
				before killing a target, you're doing a good job dealing with him. Force Staffs, Ghost Scepter, Eulses, and Banishes
				are all ideal counters.</li>
