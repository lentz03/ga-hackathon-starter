		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Count down your Glimpses.Â Glimpse is an incredibly powerful spell, but only if used intelligently.
				Glimpse will always revert someone to where they were 4 seconds prior. So as soon as you see someone out
				of position, remember where they were and start counting to four. Watch where the end location dot is
				and cast a field around it.</li>
			<li>One method to timing Glimpses is by casting a Thunder Strike on your target and then waiting for the
				third strike to trigger (the third Thunder Strike shock will occur 4.5 seconds after the initial cast).
				Plus, Thunder Strike gives you vision of your target.</li>
			<li>Glimpse will break any channels. You don't need to time the Glimpse so seamlessly that the travel time
				of the ball will trigger while they're TPing, just Glimpse them as soon as you see them.</li>
			<li>Try getting wards/vision behind towers when pushing. Players will often TP to the rear of a tower and linger
				there for >4 seconds so they don't get insta-Glimpsed. Spot them and send then from whence they came.</li>
			<li>Kinetic Field provides vision inside the circle, allowing you to scout Rosh, trees, or high ground from
				long range.</li>
			<li>The outside of Kinetic Field is just as useful as the inside. Don't be afraid to block someone on the
				outside with the edge rather than lock them in.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>TP behind trees or even one tier back if you're defending a push against Disruptor unless you like
				wasting gold. Glimpse will also be a real pain if you're a Nature's Prophet, Wisp, Spectre, or
				Tinker.</li>
			<li>Pay attention to the AoE of the Static Storm. Many a time a Disruptor will cast half of it within the
				Kinetic Field and the other half outside. Stop running against the wall of the Field and sitting in the
				Storm if you don't have to.</li>
		</ul>
