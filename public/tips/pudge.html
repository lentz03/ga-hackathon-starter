		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can Hook units that are Cycloned. They won't take any damage, but you will change their position.</li>
			<li>Part of being a good Pudge is more than landing Hooks, but also knowing when your Hooks won't land. The
				cast time is long enough that you should be able to at least occasionally stop-cancel failed Hooks.</li>
			<li>Arguably the most reliable way of predicting enemy movement for Hooks during the laning phase is to
				watch for last hits. While you're hiding, watch the HP of your creeps and wait for the enemy to pick up
				the last hit. The knowledge of where they will be plus their attack animation should be enough to land a
				Hook fairly easily. If the only thing between you and the enemy is a creep, start casting the Hook right
				before they complete the last hit so the Hook passes through the creep as it's dying.</li>
			<li>It's possible to have someone Dismembered but not in Rot range, so turn off Rot if you're not seeing
				their HP steadily trickle down.</li>
			<li>You can Salve up through the first 3 levels of Rot without it being dispelled. This applies to Pudge
				himself and any enemies he's Rotting.</li>
			<li>Spam toggle Rot to keep the slow on a target, but take minimal damage.</li>
			<li>Use Rot to help get last hits in lane against aggressively denying enemies.</li>
			<li>Common knowledge: You can deny yourself with Rot.</li>
			<li>Walking up to a hero and Dismembering them without Hooking them is like getting body shots as a Sniper
				in TF2. No one will respect you, but who cares when you get the kill.</li>
			<li>Practice targeting Dismember while an enemy is getting Hooked to give enemies as little time to react as
				possible and to ensure you ult them in the Rot radius.</li>
			<li>When Roshing, don't use Dismember unless you're absolutely safe. It's a huge red flag for the enemy team
				that Pudge is off enjoying some fresh meat (the sound is global every time you cast it) despite the
				fact there is no hero on the map getting Benihana'd.</li>
			<li>Don't <i>ever</i> shift-queue Meat Hook after Dismember. You are almost always better off canceling the
				last few milliseconds of Dismember by casting Meat Hook rather than waiting for the channel to end.</li>
			<li>Dismember lasts longer on creeps than heroes meaning you heal 360/540/720 + 180%/240%/300% of STR when you
				cast it on a creep. Useful if you need HP and don't care about the Dismember CD/mana cost.</li>
			<li>Never let Rubick steal Meat Hook. Constantly be spamming Rot against a Rubick.</li>
			<li>The Undisputed Heavyweight Illusion Rune Champion. Most heroes don't like getting illusion runes, but on
				Pudge, they're great. Don't have perfect micro skills? Of course you don't, you're playing Pudge. Get
				this, just plop a lone illusion the enemy's end of the river staring at the creep wave. You just got so
				far deep into their mid's head you could write his biography. While he's sweating bullets on the
				opposite end of the wave, walk your real self over and land the easiest hook of your life.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Play the hero and read the tips. The best way to beat a Pudge is to become the Pudge. You put Pudge into
				a cup, he becomes the cup, you put Pudge into a teapot, he becomes the teapot. Be Pudge, my friend.</li>
			<li>Target your TP directly on to the tower if you don't know where Pudge is. You'll show up at a random
				spot in a circle around the tower, making it difficult for him to predict a hook.</li>
