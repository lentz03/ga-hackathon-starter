		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>I don't care what the situation is, the Cyclone on the Storm Panda will always be useful. Cyclone the
				support so that your teammates won't waste time killing that squishy CM when they should be focusing the
				carry. Cyclone that dick Omniknight so his whole team cries at him for not ulting. Cyclone that PA who
				is slicing everyone to shreds because the rest of her team is locking your team down. Cyclone the roided
				up Sven and waste a whopping 6 seconds of God's Strength. Then when he comes back down, wait two seconds
				for it to come off cooldown and Cyclone his punk ass again.</li>
			<li>After you pick someone to twister, think about Dispelling some Magic. A few spells that you can Dispel
				include: TA's Meld, Omniknight's Repel and Guardian Angel, the Cyclone active
				from Eul's, all Runes, <a target="_blank" href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel/Removable_buffs">and a ton of other stuff.</a></li>
			<li>Casting the Storm Panda's Dispel Magic on the Cyclone will also immediately stop the Cyclone. Don't
				stand around watching the enemy spin for the full duration if your team is ready to kill them, just
				dispel it.</li>
			<li>The Storm Panda's Wind Walk gives you free bonus damage on the next attack, so use it! If you're
				quick, you should easily be able to use it twice during your ult, which is a lot of physical damage that you
				were not using before. Late game, Wind Walk will be your main escape mechanism because your Fire Panda
				will go down as soon as someone so much as farts on it, and the Earth Panda goes down surprisingly
				quickly once carries start doling out big single target damage.</li>
			<li>The Wind Walk also gives a massive move speed increase on the Storm Panda. Use it if you're trying to
				catch an escaping enemy. Once you catch up, cast the Cyclone. The Cyclone won't end even if your ult
				ends.</li>
			<li>Many a time you'll finish your Primal Split and have the entire enemy team staring hungrily at your
				Earth Panda. If you have a Blink Dagger, you shouldn't worry. No matter how many times they damage your
				Pandas, Blink Dagger will be off cooldown the moment you reform. So just position your Earth Panda where
				you can get an effective Blink, and start mashing the item hotkey.</li>
			<li>Just be sure to turn the Spirit to face the direction you want to blink in before Primal Split ends. This will
				avoid any turn animation delay since Brewmaster faces the same direction that the Spirit was last facing.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Brew is nearly impossible to kill 1v1 if you're a right clicker in the early/mid game. Between Drunken
				Haze and Drunken Brawler, hitting this guy is a miracle. And this is if Primal Split is down.</li>
			<li>Pretty much every carry should consider getting an MKB or BKB early on to deal with the miss chance on
				Drunken Haze. Manta Style, Lotus Orb, Guardian Greaves, and Diffusal Blade can purge the debuff as well.</li>
			<li>Kill the Fire Panda ASAP in the early game. This is the majority of Brewmaster's damage once he splits.
				Treat it like an Undying Tombstone.</li>
			<li>You can left click the Spirits and check their buffs to see how much time is remaining on the Split.
				This is relevant if you're trying to drop some damage/disables on the Earth panda before Brewmaster
				comes back to disable his blink.</li>
			<li>SILENSILSILSILESILENSILENCESILENCE. Dude hates silences and hexes. Primal Split has a cast time and
				Hexes and some Silences are instant. If you have these on your team he'll likely have to cut his
				Blink->Clap->Haze->Split combo to just Blink->Split.</li>
