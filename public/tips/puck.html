		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Illusory Orb is your main escape before you get your Blink Dagger. The second you toss out an Orb to
				damage some creeps, your fairie dragon ass starts looking much tastier to kill. This is most relevant
				when you're in the mid lane and you're trying to push the wave to get the rune. Only use the orb if
				you're confident that you can't get nuked down in the next ~10s.</li>
			<li>When pushing, cast Illusory Orb from the back of the enemy creep wave towards your creeps or into trees
				and then Jaunt to it. This can help create a buffer from players who will try to gank you once they see
				your orb is down.</li>
			<li>Illusory Orb gives a huge amount of flying vision. Not only does it give vision around the Orb itself,
				but the vision lingers for a few seconds along its path as well. Use it for scouting, shutting down
				juking, or finishing off couriers.</li>
			<li>There are three main ways to Jaunt the full distance reliably. Either you watch for the Orb to turn red,
				listen to the sound pitch of the Orb, or use the Orb's spell icon as a clock. The Orb travels for 3
				seconds, so Jaunt in right before the spell cooldown timer hits 11/10/9/8s. Or you can just count to 3.</li>
			<li>When you're on the run, toss an Orb in one direction and continue walking in another direction. If they
				commit to the Orb, don't Jaunt, if they commit to you, Jaunt.</li>
			<li>Puck can completely avoid spells like Ice Path and even insta-cast spells like Hexes while Phase Shifted
				as long as you blink in the direction you were facing before you Phase Shifted AND if Blink
				<i>before</i> the channel ends. If you try to blink in a different direction, you'll spend too much time
				turning around after Phase Shift and if you shift-queue, spells like Ice Path will still hit you.</li>
			<li>You only need to cast Phase Shift to disjoint things, you don't need to complete the channel. If a tower
				shot is about to pound you, just tap Phase Shift and keep moving.</li>
			<li>If you click in a direction to turn before casting Phase Shift, you'll complete your rotation while in
				Phase Shift. This is similar to the turning before RP'ing trick on Magnus.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>As soon as the Orb comes out, start looking for the kill. Puck may be hard to lock down, but Orb being
				on cooldown halves this hero's survivability in the early game.</li>
			<li>Illusory Orb travels for three seconds. Most stuns last ~2 seconds. Save your stun for around 1 second
				after an enemy Puck tosses out an Orb. If they Jaunt within that second, they didn't get very far anyway
				so whatever.</li>
			<li>Playing against Puck mid is all about baiting out useless Phase Shifts. Animation canceling is usually
				the easiest way, but smart Pucks ain't about that cancel lyfe and won't get scared by your Magnus
				practicing lacrosse with Shockwave canceling. So just wait for them to use Phase Shift for some other
				reason (tower shots, creep aggro) or try to bait it by tossing out a less important spell (Shadow Strike
				is the textbook example) or an auto-attack.</li>
			<li>Dream Coil always lasts for 6 seconds (unless Scepter'd).</li>
			<li>You can break out of the Coil without getting stunned with spells like Waveform or Ball Lightning. You
				can Blink out as well, but you'll take the damage and be stunned when you land.</li>
