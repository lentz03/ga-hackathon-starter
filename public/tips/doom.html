		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Learn the abilities and auras of neutral creeps and figure out which ones best match your playstyle. Get
				a Hill Troll Priest from an easy camp early game for the mana aura, Centaur from a medium camp mid game for
				the Stomp, and an Alpha Wolf from a medium camp late game for the crits and aura. If you're jungling, try to
				get the big red Satyr for the HP regen or the blue Ogre for the Ice Armor. If you're stacking camps, get
				the Wildwing and take down the stack with the Tornado.</li>
			<li>The net on the Dark Troll Warlord goes through spell immunity and Linken's Sphere.</li>
			<li>If enemies are picking up Linken's, find a neutral spell that is targeted to pop them before casting Doom.
				The longest range targeted neutral spell is the Harpy's Chain Lightning (900 range), and the Mud Golem's Hurl
				Boulder is a close second (800 range).</li>
			<li><b>DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM</b> mutes usage of items. Besides stopping someone from TPing, it's also
				useful against Mek or Pipe carriers.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Pay attention to what creep ability Doom has by clicking on him. Don't get surprised when his team
				rushes out of nowhere because he has the Kobold aura or if he breaks your channel because he took a Centaur
				Stomp.</li>
			<li>Linken's Sphere is the textbook anti-Doom item. Lotus Orb is also good for offensive situations.</li>
			<li>Please deny your allies when they're Doomed. I'm not walking near you because I want to tell my wife I
				love her, I need you to kill me.</li>
			<li>However, you ideally want to click on your ally and track how much time is left on the Doom debuff icon
				because deny range != dead range.</li>
			<li><b>DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOM</b> mutes items, including that Magic Wand that I know you want to use
				so badly because it should be enough to just barely sav... you're dead.</li>
