		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Sacrifice is always the first thing you level and you should immediately eat a ranged creep (more XP
				given than a melee creep) at 0:00. Ideally, you should eat it from mid lane if you trust your mid.</li>
			<li>You can Sacrifice siege creeps.</li>
			<li>You can cast Ice Armor on creeps. If you're trying to help out on a push, start slapping Ice Armor on
				all your frontline creeps to slow the enemy's melee creeps and buff up your own.</li>
			<li>You can cast Ice Armor on <i>all</i> towers and buildings. Everyone forgets this.</li>
			<li>Chain Frost has a ministun on the very first target it hits. If you see Sand King headbanging, it can be
				worth using your Chain Frost on him to stop his channel. Similarly, it can be worth using Chain Frost on
				an enemy BKB'd carry that's trying to TP out of an ill-fated farming adventure since the stun goes
				through BKB. Don't worry about the slow projectile speed, the stun is triggered as soon as you cast, not
				when it hits.</li>
			<li>Don't always let the Chain Frost go as soon as you get into cast range. The projectile is incredibly
				slow and targets will usually split faster than the ball can travel. The closer you can get to your
				initial target, the better chances you have of getting successful bounces off.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You're losing out on a <i>lot</i> of experience per wave when laning against Lich because of Sacrifice. The enemies will
				likely hit 6 significantly before you do, so beware of aggression.</li>
			<li>It's very hard to win a lane against Lich for this reason. However, you can turn this power against him by pushing hard
				and taking his tower early since he'll have a shortage of creeps each wave. Even if you don't have good pushing heroes,
				try single pulling a wave.</li>
		</ul>
