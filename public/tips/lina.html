		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>While Lina has a terrible auto-attack animation, she also has ludicrous range to compensate. Few heroes
				can trade hits with you, despite your pizza spinning auto attack.</li>
			<li>It's okay to blow a few spells to keep Fiery Soul stacks up. Once you have a high enough mana regen, you
				can keep yourself at Sonic speeds by alternating between Dragon Slave and LSA. Build up stacks in the
				fountain before a TP or use spells on nothing to speed up an escape.</li>
			<li>Laguna Blade has a stupid short cooldown for how effective it is at 6. Abuse it.</li>
			<li>An Agh upgraded Laguna can target and kill couriers.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Laguna Blade will only penetrate BKB once Lina gets an Aghanim's Scepter.</li>
		</ul>
