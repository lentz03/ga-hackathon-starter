		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Spread your spells out. If you land a close range stun, don't just pull the trigger on Rift. Get a few
				hits, wait for them to walk away for a bit, then suck back them.</li>
			<li>This is fairly common knowledge, but please turn on your Armlet before you Phantasm. Congratulations,
				you got super beefy illusions with no HP drain. This is also true pre-Manta or pre-Illusion rune for
				every hero.</li>
			<li>You can use the cast animation on Phantasm to juke projectiles.</li>
			<li>If you're about to die, take a risk and send one of your illusions where you wanted to go while you sit
				still. Most people will assume you have garbage micro and continue pursuing whichever one is moving.</li>
			<li>You don't really need to level Phantasm at level 6. Besides the fact that it costs nearly all your mana,
				you can't really get kills with it until your other spells are higher level.</li>
			<li>I don't often recommend starting items, but CK is an excellent Mango carrier.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Reality Rift and Chaos Bolt have amusingly long cast times. If you're getting chased by CK, use tree fog
				liberally to juke his spells.</li>
			<li>Enchantress is a notable CK counter since Untouchable makes her very difficult to kill by CK alone and she
				can easily steal Phantasm illusions.</li>
			<li>Lion is another notable CK counter since he can quickly burn off Phantasm illusions with Hex and Mana Drain.
				</li>
