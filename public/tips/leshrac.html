		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The outrageously long cast animation on Split Earth is both a blessing and a curse. It's mainly a curse,
				but you can use it to your advantage. In lane, there are few things more irritating than seeing a
				Leshrac go all <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_Crossing_the_Alps#mediaviewer/File:Napoleon4.jpg">Napoleon Crossing the Alps,</a>
				moving so you don't get stunned, and then him canceling the animation. You can also use the cast
				animation to stun people chasing you without having to turn around by casting it directly in front of
				your feet.</li>
			<li>When munching on a tower with Edict, become a zen master of positioning. Leshrac is one of the few
				heroes who can successfully push towers even while your creep wave changes aggro from the tower to the
				next enemy creep wave. Just stand in the corner of the AoE so that you're only seeing explosions
				underneath the tower and give her the edict. If you don't right click, you won't draw any aggro and the
				tower will continue attacking whichever unit is closest, which will still be the creeps.</li>
			<li>Try to bait out a glyph when you walk up to a tower before using Edict. Edict has a cast time, so try to
				cancel it during your T-pose. Most of the time people will just glyph the second they see Leshrac smugly
				standing alone by their tower, but it's still worth a shot.</li>
			<li>Edict can hit invisible units. Try chasing down invis enemies if you think they'll be traveling a
				predictable path.</li>
			<li>Eul's is a great item on Leshrac. Aside from the fact that he loves all the stats, Cyclone makes landing Split Earth
				on solo targets far easier..</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Split Earth is one of the easiest stuns in the game to juke. It has an incredibly obvious cast animation
				and has an eternity of a cast time. It is usually worth running backwards a small distance just to dodge
				it.</li>
			<li>Don't glyph your structures until you see Leshrac turn on his Edict if he's pushing your towers.</li>
