		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Untouchable makes you a great hero to tank Rosh since he attacks in bullet time.</li>
			<li>You can Enchant nearly every enemy/neutral unit. Necronomicon creeps and enemy illusions are both A+++
				steals.</li>
			<li>You can re-cast Enchant on a controlled unit to refresh the duration.</li>
			<li>Impetus calculates the damage by the distance between you and the target once the projectile hits the
				target. There's a cap at 1750 distance.</li>
			<li>Impetus goes through spell immunity.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you're a right clicker, try to let your supports take care of Bambi. You'll be wasting your time
				trying to kill her mid game when nukes will touch her Untouchable fluffy tail quicker than you can.</li>
