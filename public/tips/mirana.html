		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>The second Starstorm hit will land on the closest target to you in a 425 radius.</li>
			<li>The idea behind landing consistent arrows is trying to throw them in a way that gives you a large window
				to hit a target and a small window for them to notice the arrow. If you're tossing out arrows that are
				90 degrees opposite your target, you're giving yourself a very small frame for the arrow to hit. It can
				be smart to sacrifice some time of the target running to give yourself a more forgiving/parallel angle.</li>
			<li>The more realistic idea behind landing consistent arrows is pairing it with other stuns or disables.</li>
			<li>During downtime, you can quickly one-shot a big creep in the jungle with a Sacred Arrow for some easy experience
				and gold. The biggest creeps usually chill in the back of creep camps, so learn how to position yourself accordingly.
				Just be sure to finish off the rest of the camp so it'll respawn... Unless you're sniping enemy jungle camps, I guess.</li>
			<li>Sacred Arrow can also one-shot siege creeps.</li>
			<li>Pay attention to the map to see if you can use Moonlight Shadow to help out teammates.</li>
			<li>Also pay attention to the map to make sure none of your teammates are in vision when using Moonlight Shadow offensively.
				If enemies see the crescent moon buff show up over one of your allies for no reason, they'll probably start playing very safe.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If there's a Mirana on the enemy team, treat her like a Pudge as far as movement and positioning is
				concerned. Hug creeps, don't stand still, and get mad at your teammates for being arrow magnets.</li>
			<li>If you suspect Mirana is hanging around a tower that you're TPing to, target your TP directly on to the
				tower. You'll show up at a random spot in a circle around the tower, making it difficult for her to
				predict an arrow.</li>
			<li>Moonlight Shadow lasts 15 seconds. That's an eternity in Dota time. You really need a ton of sentry
				wards and dust whenever you're pushing into a competent team that has a PotM.</li>
