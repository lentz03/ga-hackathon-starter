		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Mirror Image can purge all the debuffs that a Manta would (besides Silences, obviously). Look at the
				lane you're up against to see if an early Mirror Image could save your skin (like for Open Wounds or
				Grave Chill). Mirror Image's split time also allows you to be invulnerable when projectile spells like
				Wraith King or Sven's stuns hit.</li>
			<li>Send a unified move command (look in your options to find out what the key modifier is, by default it's
				CTRL) after you split otherwise it's super obvious which Naga Naga Naga Naga is 100% Naga. Or if you're
				a fan of Mindgamez™, send a lone illusion out from the school and act nonchalant while the enemies gun
				it down.</li>
			<li>Although couriers possess an unparalleled understanding on the intricacies of space and time, they are
				like dolphins and get caught in those six-pack plastic can things all the time. Ensnare will bind both
				walking and flying couriers.</li>
			<li>After you hit 6 and you're quietly farming, you should always try to keep at least 175 mana in the bank.
				100 for the Song, 75 for the TP.</li>
			<li>If you aren't partied up in a 5 stack, just use your ult defensively. <i>"Buuuut moooom, all the other 
				heroes get to press R in a team fight." "Maybe when you're older, Slithice. Why can't you be like that
				nice boy Terrorblade and use your ult situationally?"</i></li>
			<li>You didn't listen to me, did you. You used it. See, Naga, this is why we can't trust you... Now look.
				Everyone is shuffling around awkwardly on your team because they're both seething with rage and because
				they can't tell if you want to commit to this failed fight or not. Hey. Hey, it's okay. Just press R
				again. Yeah that's right, you can cancel your ult. You can just act like it was a misclick.</li>
			<li>Supposing you DO have a group of teammates who can take advantage of Song, here are some notable
				interactions with it. <b>Razor</b> - Sleep doesn't stop Static Link. <b>Undying</b> - Zombies continue
				to spawn on sleeping enemies. <b>Warlock</b> - Channel a fat Upheaval during the Sleep. <b>Dazzle</b> -
				Weave can hit Sleeping enemies and will continue to tick during the Sleep. <b>Omniknight</b> - You can
				offensively Repel one enemy to bring them out of Sleep.</li>
			<li>If an enemy activated a BKB in a team fight and there aren't any huge allied spells being thrown out,
				you can try to isolate them with Song. Sleep the rest of the team and kill the spell immune enemy.</li>
			<li>Enemy structures are invulnerable during Song, but allied structures aren't. This allows you to get
				uncontestable and rage inducing denies on towers.</li>
			<li>If you're TPing in to save teammates during a dive, consider starting the Song before you begin
				channeling your TP.</li>
			<li>There aren't many situations in which you want to use all 7 seconds of your ult. If you catch someone
				out with it, cancel it as soon as people are in position rather than buying the enemy team even more
				time to get over there.</li>
			<li>Roshan is deaf. Sing near Rosh to quickly steal the kill+Aegis from the enemy, or to allow you to finish
				Rosh without the enemy team causing a ruckus in the pit.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Be wary of activating any sort of spell immunity before Naga uses Sleep, otherwise you might be setting
				yourself up to die before the team fight even starts.</li>
			<li>Glyph makes towers immune to Sleep, allowing them to continue firing.</li>
			<li>Ensnare will interrupt any channels, reveal you if you're invis, disable you from blinking, and go
				through spell immunity.</li>
			<li>Ensnare is dispellable by items like Diffusal Blade, Guardian Greaves, Eul's, Lotus Orb or Manta
				Style.</li>
		</ul>
