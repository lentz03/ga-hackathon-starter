		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Starting from level 2 of Take Aim, you can hit towers without them hitting you. Use it in conjunction
				with the vision that Shrapnel gives you for easy night sieges.</li>
			<li>You can cancel Assassinations with the Stop key.</li>
			<li>Assassinate provides shared vision around the target. This is useful when dealing with high ground (sieging
				or defending) since you can keep casting it and canceling it on enemies/creeps to see around them.</li>
			<li>With no additional magic resistance (like from Cloak, Spell Shield, or being Meepo), Assassination deals
				~240/365/487 raw damage. Avoid discharging impotent Assassinations. Sniper doesn't have a lot of mana
				and you need every second you can get in lane farming, rather than sitting in the fountain complaining
				about how someone didn't die to your ult.</li>
			<li>The hero that needs to exploit positioning in lane the most. The Sniper Shuffle is the complex laning
				dance that involves waddling forward, popping the enemy in the face until you get a Headshot, pissing
				them off, running backwards, praying that they don't feel like wasting the energy to kill you, and
				waiting for them to retreat. Then repeat. The better you are at predicting enemy movement, the better
				Sniper you can be.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you're getting Assassinated, you will have an icon in your buffs. The shot will get fired when the
				buff timer goes around halfway. It can't be disjointed by traditional invisibility (only Smoke of
				Deceit and Shadow Dance), but if you're quick you can dodge it once the projectile is about to hit you with spells like
				Rage, Disruption, or Leap or items like BKB, Eul's, or even Blink Dagger.</li>
			<li>Infused Raindrop can save your life from some early game Assassinations.</li>
