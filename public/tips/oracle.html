		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Fortune's End is basically the only cheap offensive purge in the game, so here are some buffs worth
				noting that can be purged: Aphotic Shield, Strafe, Surge, Ion Shell, Flame Guard, Empower, Overpower, Ghost Scepter,
				Crimson Guard's active, and Haste/Invis/DD runes.</li>
			<li>Fortune's End also serves as a basic dispel when cast on allies.
				<a href="http://dota2.gamepedia.com/Dispel/Removable_debuffs">Here's a list of useful things you can dispel.</a>
				tl;dr - Most silences, slows, roots, and other non-stun debuffs.</li>
			<li>Every enemy in the AoE of the Fortune's End projectile gets damaged, purged, and stopped upon landing.</li>
			<li>That includes ally-targeted Fortune's Ends. If Omniknight Repelled an enemy before you could target them, target
				an ally and make them stand next to the Repelled target to purge it off.</li>
			<li>You can self-target Fortune's End. If an enemy is closing in on you, or you can't target an enemy, start channeling
				it on yourself. Invis units can get hit by Fortune's End.</li>
			<li>You can be cute and pre-channel Fortune's End on a blinking or TPing ally so if they run into an enemy,
				you may catch someone in the stop/purge AoE (or purge off something like a silence from your ally).</li>
			<li>The damage on Fortune's End <i>does not scale</i> the longer you channel it. This isn't Powershot. Only
				the 'stop' duration scales.</li>
			<li>And honestly, the 'stop' aspect of Fortune's End is the least important part. The main reason you use
				this spell is for the purge and the damage.</li>
			<li>Fortune's End is not a stun and will not break enemy channels. It just sets their MS to 0.</li>
			<li>Break the Fortune's End channel by casting Purifying Flames on your target. This won't work if
				your target is less than 400 distance away from you since the Fortune's End projectile will land too quickly.</li>
			<li>You can target and channel Fortune's End on a Cycloned target. Releasing the projectile won't cancel a
				Cyclone, though.</li>
			<li>The purge from Fortune's End can take the Fate's Edict debuff off allies and enemies.</a>
			<li>Don't use Fate's Edict offensively unless you're a 100% sure your team fully understands how the spell
				works. Yes I know it's a great disarm, but people are dumb and get mad at you for making the enemy immune to magic damage.</li>
			<li>This is core knowledge for playing Oracle: Cast Fate's Edict first on an ally before Flaming them.
				They'll be immune to <s>hurt feelings</s> the nuke damage, but still get the heal.</li>
			<li>You can also cast Glimmer Cape on allies before Flaming them to reduce the nuke damage.</li>
			<li>Once maxed, each full duration Flame will give ~120 HP to a hero (enemy or ally) with standard magic
				resistance.</li>
			<li>Fate's Edict can disarm Rosh.</li>
			<li>Purifying Flames and Fate's Edict both work on enemy, allied, or neutral creeps. If you Fate's Edict any
				lane creep, they immediately stop pathing and just stand around for some reason.</li>
			<li>Purifying Flames will never deal lethal damage to allied heroes or allied creeps/summons.</li>
			<li>You can get ninja denies on your creeps by Purifying them and then immediately going for the deny attack
				to finish them off.</li>
			<li>You almost never want to cast Purifying Flames on an enemy unless you're absolutely sure you can purge
				it or you're sure you can kill the target in the next ~5 seconds (it takes 6 seconds for the heal to
				compensate the damage with standard 25% magic resistance).</li>
			<li>False Promise is your highest range spell. If you're trying to save someone, don't bother Edicting, or
				Flaming them first, just use False Promise right off the bat.</li>
			<li>You can False Promise creep-hero units like Warlock's Golem or the Spirit Bear.</li>
			<li>The globe effect above a False Promised hero indicates the current state of damage. A green orb means
				they've healed more and a fiery red orb means they've taken more damage. At least, that's what it's <i>supposed</i>
				to mean. I think I see the red orb, like, 100% of the time even if the target looks like they ate a cheese after the
				spell ends.</li>
			<li>A False Promised hero can never have their Blink Dagger broken.</li>
			<li>The only ways of cheating a False Promise death are with Dazzle's Shallow Grave or Abaddon's Borrowed
				Time.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Fortune's End is <i>not</i> a stun, so it won't break channels. It just sets your movespeed to 0.</li>
			<li>Culling Blade can kill through False Promise.</li>
		</ul>
