		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Reflection only catches heroes in vision.</li>
			<li>Reflection illusions carry all the auras that normal enemy illusions carry.</li>
			<li>Use Conjure Image illusions to stack the jungle, serve as wards, intercept an incoming creep wave, or deny runes
				in the early game.</li>
			<li>Activating Metamorphosis serves as a disjoint for both you and all your illusions.</li>
			<li>However, bear in mind that you lose 25 movespeed when you transform.</li>
			<li>If you're planning on getting aggressive in lane soon, it's in your best interest to pre-cast a Conjure Image and
				hide it. 16 seconds later, load up another one and then go in.</li>
			<li>Metamorphosis is <i>not</i> lost on death. That means TB will keep however much time was left on Metamorphosis after an
				Aegis respawn or buyback.</li>
			<li>Manta Style has a longer cooldown and weaker illusions for ranged heroes than melee heroes. Activate Manta
				<i>before</i> casting Metamorphosis.</li>
			<li>Sunder can be cast on allies and illusions (like Conjure Image or Manta illusions).</li>
			<li>Sunder has a minimum HP transfer of 25%. So if you and an ally are both under 25% HP, Sunder will heal you both.</li>
			<li>You can Sunder through AA's Ice Blast to gain HP. You can Sunder a Borrowed Time Abaddon to make him lose HP.</li>
			<li>Infused Raindrops are amazing on TB. He has tons of armor, but is very susceptible to magic damage nukes.
				The mana regen from the item is just gravy.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Reflection illusions carry all things that normal illusions carry. This includes item auras, so be wary about building
				things like Radiance or AC against a TB.</li>
			<li>TB has armor out the butt, but very little HP to back it up. Magic damage makes life for TB and his illusions hell. If
				your team is mostly physical damage, consider building Maelstrom or Shiva's (yeah I know I just told you not to build auras,
				but Shiva's is usually worth it) to clear his illusions.</li>
			<li>Sunder. It's a spell. One that you should be acutely aware of when trying to kill him.</li>
		</ul>
