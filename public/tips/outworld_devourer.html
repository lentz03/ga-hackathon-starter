		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Time Imprisonments right before the enemy goes for a last hit. It's super annoying to get Harbinged
				right before killing a creep.</li>
			<li>You can put Roshan in Astral jail for 4 seconds.</li>
			<li>If you're getting ganked in the early game, try using a Bottle charge or some sort of regen item right
				before self-Imprisoning yourself. The regen will continue healing while you're banished.</li>
			<li>You can cancel enemy (or ally) Boots of Travels by Imprisoning the unit that's being teleported on.</li>
			<li>The Imprisonment ends when the orange circle at the top fully expands. If your team has spells that can
				combo with Astral, keep this in mind.</li>
			<li>If an enemy team comp is very mana-intensive, use Sanity's Eclipse early on in a teamfight to take advantage
				of the mana burn. If they're not and you'd rather get more damage, steal some INT with Arcane Orb first
				before casting Sanity's Eclipse.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Nyx nyx nyx nyx. Mana Burn is the most anti-OD spell in the game.</li>
			<li>Pugna pugna pugna pugna. Nether Ward is the second most anti-OD spell in the game.</li>
			<li>Bkb bkb bkb bkb. Spell immunity is the most anti-OD state in the game.</li>
