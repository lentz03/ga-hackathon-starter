		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Remember to change your orbs for their passive uses during the game. I know it's difficult to keep track
				and a lot of Invokers like to have their next spell Pre-Voked, but those 3 Wex orbs can make the
				difference between you catching up to an enemy or not. Or those 3 Quas orbs early on could save your
				life mid.</li>
			<li>Cold Snap has ridiculous range. Use it to cancel Bottle charges on the enemy mid from a distance if you
				have vision of them.</li>
			<li>Urn of Shadows can trigger a Cold Snap every ~0.5s.</li>
			<li>Pay attention to what your teammates are doing before you Tornado in a team fight. It's a great spell
				and all, but it also has Naga Sleep levels of destroying your teammates plans.</li>
			<li>Tornado has a purging effect that can take off runes or certain buffs, like Meld.</li>
			<li>I remember Alacrity's spell combo because every time I cast it, it's time to lay the
				<b>WWE Smackdown SHUT YOUR MOUTH.</b></li>
			<li>Alacrity can be cast on siege creeps. Tether+Overcharge and Bloodlust them as well for huge hyperexcited
				catapults.</li>
			<li>Forge Spirits are invaluable for pushing. They have amazing range late game, serve as two extra damaging
				and tanking units, can cut off the creep wave, and they last forever.</li>
			<li>Forge Spirits are also great if you're mid to serve as rune control. Spawn a Forge Spirit around 20
				seconds before the even minute mark and have it sit at the rune to kill it.</li>
			<li>Ghost Walk is QQW. I remember this because every time I get ganked I want to QQ... W.</li>
			<li>You can cast Ghost Walk while channeling a TP. Just don't change your orbs or Invoke while you're
				channeling though, because that'll cancel it.</li>
			<li>Don't change your orbs in Ghost Walk. Pressing any hotkey will instantly dispel your invis. Ideally,
				you'll want to throw up 3 Wexes before you Ghost Walk, but you'll rarely be able to pull that off in a
				gank situation.</li>
			<li>Ice Wall is actually ridiculous in the mid lane matchup. With 3 points in Quas it's a 60% slow. If
				someone's making a move on your high ground and you're trying to shake them off, you can potentially get
				even more return damage by casting Ice Wall instead of Cold Snap.</li>
			<li>With practice, you can lay Ice Wall perpendicularly to catch escaping enemies. It's effectively a 650
				range slow if you can aim it right.</li>
			<li>Learn and practice the stereotypical Invoker combos: EMP+Tornado, Forge Spirits+Cold Snap, Chaos
				Meteor+Sun Strike+Deafening Blast, Forge Spirits+Alacrity, Tornado+Sun Strike, Ice Wall+Being the
				greatest spell in Voker's arsenal that is criminally underused.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Always keep tabs on the spells he has Invoked by clicking on him to get a better idea of how he's
				building. If you're mid and he has Sun Strike invoked, warn your team. If he's missing and he's been
				going Q/W, tell them to watch out for a Tornado from the trees.</li>
			<li>Try to remember he has Sun Strike BEFORE you think you narrowly escaped the first gank of the game,
				rather than after.</li>
			<li>Forge Spirits burn off your armor with each of their attacks. Invoker isn't just harassing you just to
				be a dick. Well he is, but he's also trying to soften you up for whatever is about to happen next.</li>
			<li>For the love of everything, please bring some sort of detection when trying to gank Invoker. Ghost Walk is <i>not</i> a good escape, dude needs 4 points in Wex to not slow himself.</li>
