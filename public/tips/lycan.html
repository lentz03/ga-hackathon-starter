		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Wolves are quite possibly the strongest scouting tool in the game. Once they hit 4 you have two 460 move
				speed, permanently invisible, 55 second observer wards on demand. Use this to scout, check/kill runes,
				block/stack camps, body block targets, and most importantly, follow around high priority targets. If you
				want them to quietly hunt someone, issue a follow command. Press (default) M+left click on a hero. Your
				wolf will tail your target but never attack and break invisibility. However, be aware that when the
				duration of the wolf ends, the enemy hero will suddenly see a wolf keel over and die next to him,
				possibly compromising your sneakiness.</li>
			<li>When jungling or Roshing, you can shake neutral aggro off your wolves the same way you can drop tower
				aggro. Select the wolf in question and then a+click another allied unit and the creeps should start
				focusing another unit.</li>
			<li>Howl is a game changing skill. It's practically a 10 second Demon Edge for your whole team at level 4.
				Pay attention to what your team is doing on the map and use it to help them even if you're not there.</li>
			<li>Always use Smoke before going into the Rosh pit.</li>
			<li>Don't feed Necronomicon creeps just for a few more seconds of tower damage. They're worth a sizable gold
				and experience bounty.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Pay attention to when the enemy team is Howl'd. Not only can you not trade hits with them now, but it
				can be a good signal that Lycan is Roshing.</li>
			<li>While you can't slow him when he's Shapeshifted, mass Eul's is a great way to keep him on lockdown. It's
				cheap enough that most people on your team can build it and it buys time for other stuns to come off
				cooldown.</li>
