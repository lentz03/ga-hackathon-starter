		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Tower shots or creep attacks won't wake enemies up from Echo Stomp.</li>
			<li>Don't start whaling on an enemy as soon as you land the Sleep. Get a better position, let your team get
				into a better position, then go to town.</li>
			<li>Cast Echo Stomp when the Spirit is on its way back home. Cast the Spirit, step on some fools, then have it walk down the lane so the enemy
				team will forget about it. Then when it's on the way back, cast Echo Stomp and your Spirit's hips will
				start moving on their own~. Since the Spirit returns at 600 move speed, players won't always react quick
				enough to dodge it.</li>
			<li>The Spirit walks around as fast as ET is at the time of casting. This means that a Surged ET will have a
				Surge-speed Spirit.</li>
			<li>This also makes Phase Boots surprisingly great on ET since you can activate Phase and then cast Spirit
				and have it roam around at Phased speeds for its entire duration.</li>
			<li>Having your Spirit sit around on enemies in lane just for Natural Order is useless if you're not
				planning on attacking them any time soon. Have your Spirit go suck up some more damage/farm by sending
				it into jungle camps rather than sitting around spooning heroes.</li>
			<li>You can use a long-distance Spirit Return to your advantage to set up for kills. Spirit starts cooling
				down whenever it's cast, not whenever it's Returned. When the Spirit comes back from its semester
				abroad, start pounding on people with the extra bonus damage and you'll have another Spirit ready in the
				chamber to finish them off.</li>
			<li>Use the Spirit to scout out fogged areas during pushes or defenses.</li>
			<li>During chases, try to pincer your target by casting the Spirit on a choke point. Either they have to run
				through the whole thing and risk getting slept or they have to change paths.</li>
			<li>Anyone on your team can teleport to the Spirit using Boots of Travel.</li>
			<li>You can right click an enemy when your Spirit is selected to have it follow the target for its
				duration.</li>
			<li>Ideally, you want to cast Earth Splitter as far away from the enemy team as possible to give them the
				smallest amount of time to react to the crack approaching.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>With shpeed. Elder Titan is a very unwieldy hero. His Stomp is slow, his Spirit is slow, Earth Splitter
				is slow. If you can move fast and avoid his spells, you can evade a lot of damage that ET should be
				dealing to you.</li>
			<li>Similarly, Force Staff gives you an easy eject button if you're getting comboed into some of his
				spells.</li>
		</ul>
