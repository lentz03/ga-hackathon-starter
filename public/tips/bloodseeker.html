		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Bloodrage increases <i>all</i> damage dealt to/from a hero. This means that spells and items will also
				deal increased damage if a hero is Bloodraged.</li>
			<li>You can Bloodrage allied or enemy creeps right before they die and lifesteal if you last hit them if you
				don't want to risk casting it on yourself.</li>
			<li>Enemies can't easily use Blink Dagger if they're Ruptured. It has a pretty long cast range and the
				debuff lasts a ridiculously long time, so it can be useful to perma-cancel a Blink from an initiator
				like Tidehunter or Magnus before a teamfight begins.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>TP scroll. Seriously. Just TP out if he's ganking you. He can't do anything about it.</li>
			<li>Consider getting a Magic Stick against Bloodseeker. Chances are he's going to be spamming Bloodrage like
				crazy in lane and each cast will give you a charge.</li>
			<li>Get a Mek or Urn on your team and carry around lots of regen early on. If BS isn't getting Thirsty, he
				can't deal much damage.</li>
			<li>Salve and Bottle regen won't break on a level 6 Rupture. Level 11/16 Rupture deals too much damage,
				though, and will break both.</li>
			<li>Blade Mail can be good if you're tanky, especially if he Ruptures you.</li>
			<li>Remember that he's taking a ton of extra damage if he has Bloodrage on, so don't be afraid to fight
				back.</li>
			<li>Kiss juking goodbye if there's a Bloodseeker on the enemy team. Once a match you'll find yourself
				wondering, "HOW DID THEY KNOW I WAS THERE???" Then you'll look up and realize that Bloodseeker was
				giving his team global vision of your ass when you're under 25% HP.</li>
			<li>In the same vein, be extremely careful when jungling against an enemy Bloodseeker. If he detects you at
				a dangerous HP, you can be sure that his whole team will be trying to score a kill on you.</li>
