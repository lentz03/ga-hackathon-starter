		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>"Nah he's dead, Death Pulse will kill him." HAHAHAHA, no. Death Pulse never gets them. Somehow people
				will always heal just barely enough HP just in time that the skull won't kill them. Always finish the
				kill either with Heartstopper, Scythe, or auto attacks.</li>
			<li>Death Pulse can hit invis and fogged units.</li>
			<li>The stun on Reaper's Scythe goes through BKB. That's neat.</li>
			<li>For heroes with standard magic resistance the magic numbers for getting a kill with Scythe are at
				31%/35%/40% of HP remaining.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can't disjoint Death Pulse, so don't bother trying.</li>
			<li>Glimmer Cape absolutely obliterates Necro. Save it for when he's Scything a target and then be amazed at
				how little damage the Scythe does.</li>
			<li>Dazzle's Shallow Grave, Oracle's Fate's Edict and False Promise, and heroes that can banish a Scythed target like Shadow Demon,
				Outworld Devourer, and Tusk are also good counters.</li>
