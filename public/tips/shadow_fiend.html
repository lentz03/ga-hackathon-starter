		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Cancel your Razes. The cast time is long, so if you know you're going to miss, hit the stop key.</li>
			<li>If you're having a hard time in lane, go stack the nearest jungle camp and Raze it down for quick souls.
				This is more viable on Radiant than Dire.</li>
			<li>When taking a stack, it may be in your best interests to kill the creeps that provide magic resistance
				(The small Hellbear and the small Centaur) before Razing the stack down.</li>
			<li>One of the most useful heroes to learn Tread switching for since he can make use of all three attributes
				and frequently gets a bottle.</li>
			<li>Almost the entire Requiem of Souls cast animation is hidden by Shadow Blade invisibility.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Destroying SF's laning phase is the textbook example of "shutting down" a hero. The hero doesn't have
				any escapes and isn't very tanky. He can recover by stacking and razing down jungle camps so if you <i>really</i>
				want to make sure he doesn't become a threat, block his jungle camps as well.</li>
			<li>Don't forget that he mini-ults when he di--too late, you ate it.</li>
			<li>Remember that SF loses half his Necromastery souls on death. So if he just respawned or bought back, he's not going to be at full power.</li>
			<li>Infused Raindrop can block the 'landing' damage on Eul's, allowing you to Blink out if SF tries to Cyclone+Ult combo you.</li>
