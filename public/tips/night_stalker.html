		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You don't need to pop everything on one target during a gank. Silence one hero, Void another hero, then
				kill them all.</li>
			<li>Avoid taking traditional ganking routes if possible. You're crazy fast at night so you can afford to
				sacrifice some travel time in order to avoid walking into the typical warded areas.</li>
			<li>Use TPs liberally during night time. Show yourself in one lane, then TP to another once the wave dies.
				This makes your ganks far more unpredictable.</li>
			<li>Buy your own wards if you need to. It takes no time at all for you to run into the enemy jungle to ward
				it up and you'll make back the gold in just one kill.</li>
			<li>Leveling Darkness at 6 is situational. If you would rather make your killing potential higher with
				another level in Hunter for the first night, skip Darkness until later.</li>
			<li>To fully exploit Darkness, you really need to understand how blind enemies are when it's active. Every
				enemy hero, ward, and building will have vision in only a 675 radius around them when it's Night Stalker
				O'Clock. That's essentially auto attack range for ranged heroes.</li>
			<li>Don't be afraid to use Darkness even at night. If you're not near your team and they're getting in a
				fight, you can use Darkness to help reduce enemy vision even further.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>NS is essentially an M1 Abrams with wings. Dude has 5.5 armor right off the bat. This is what makes him
				such a terrifying tower diver.</li>
			<li>Like against Bounty Hunter, if NS blows his stun early, try to TP out.</li>
