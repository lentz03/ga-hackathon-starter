		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you're hitting a single target and Split Shot is toggled on, you're still taking the damage nerf.
				Stop taking Rosh or pushing creepless towers with Split Shot on.</li>
			<li>Illusions will either have Split Shot on or off depending on how you had it toggled before they
				spawned.</li>
			<li>Mystic Snake bounces are <i>not random.</i> The Snake will always take the shortest possible bounce
				once it reaches a target. This means that a Mystic Snake targeted on a melee creep will almost always bounce between other melee creeps before jumping to the ranged creep because they're always so tightly packed. It also means that if a hero is hanging around near their ranged creep, the Snake will almost definitely bounce to them before going to the rest of the creep wave.</li>
			<li>The way the damage scales on Mystic Snake is opposite of Fade Bolt. You're gaining damage for each
				target hit, not losing it. Don't shoot the Snake directly at the enemy hero in lane if you want to get
				the max damage.</li>
			<li>"Damn, I really wished I had Mana Shield turned off before that gank," said no Medusa ever. At a certain
				point in the game (read: after the laning phase) there are very few reasons to ever have Mana Shield
				turned off. Only if you're unsure if you'll have mana to use Stone Gaze should you have it off.</li>
			<li>Even though enemies have full magic resistance when in Stone Form, Mystic Snake will deal pure damage to
				any petrified targets.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>When a Mystic Snake gets tossed out on the lane ask yourself, "Would Fade Bolt be able to jump to me
				from here?" If you said yes, then you probably already got hit by it.</li>
			<li>Remember that Diffusal is no longer an orb effect, so consider if it's worth getting to counter Dusa's
				Mana Shield.</li>
			<li>Your all-purpose mana burners are good against Dusa. Invoker (EMP), Nyx (Mana Burn),
				Keeper of the Light (Mana Leak), Outworld Devourer (Arcane Orb and Sanity's Eclipse), Lion (Mana Drain), Clockwerk (Cog burn), Anti-Mage (Mana Break) are obvious counterpicks. Heroes who easily build
				Diffusal Blade (PL, Riki, Naga, Spectre) or Necronomicon (Beastmaster, Lycan) are also good.</li>
		</ul>
