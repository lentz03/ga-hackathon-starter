		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Try to catch people in your Acid Spray if you're about to stun them. Besides the fact that they'll take
				damage over time by being stunned in the spray, the spray lowers armor significantly and Unstable
				Concoction deals physical damage. A 360 damage physical nuke is good, but a 360 damage physical nuke
				with a ton of minus armor is even better.</li>
			<li>Be aware that enemies can see the Concoction countdown timer.</li>
			<li>If you're teleporting into a fight, try casting Unstable Concoction before you start the TP. That way
				you'll have a pre-cooked stun the second you show up.</li>
			<li>You can use Unstable Concoction's self-detonate to deny yourself.</li>
			<li>With exceptional timing, you can dodge the self-stun on a failed Concoction by activating Chemical Rage
				at the moment of detonation.</li>
			<li>Activating Chemical Rage disjoints projectiles on cast.</li>
			<li>You get 30 seconds between stacks on Greevil's Greed. If you're freefarming, you should be hitting the
				max cap constantly. If you're jungling, learn how to strategically draw aggro from neutral creeps using
				Acid Spray to keep stacks up.</li>
			<li>If you're starved for mana and you're sitting on a Basi ring, disassemble it if you're Chemically Raged.
				The bonus mana regen you're getting from your ult is counted as base mana regen, thus a percentage based
				item (such as the Sage Mask) from your Basi ring will regen mana quicker than a flat regen item (such as
				the full Basilius.)</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Unstable Concoction detonates in a small AoE. Don't give your teammate a hug if they're about to get hit
				by the Concoction because it'll stun both of you. Similarly, if you have Alchemist disabled, beware of
				it self-detonating on Alchemist. It'll stun you if you're standing too close to him.</li>
			<li>Just because you think the DoT from Acid Spray isn't hurting you that much doesn't mean you should stand
				around in it. Acid Spray drops your armor substantially, which makes it extremely tempting for someone
				like a TA or Bounty Hunter to walk in and pop your ass.</li>
			<li>Alchemist himself has pretty garbage armor, so armor-debuffing spells and items are great for killing
				him through Chemical Rage.</li>
			<li>You can click on Alchemist to see how much time is left on the Chemical Rage buff. Try to time your
				ganks when the buff is about to run out.</li>
			<li>Ancient Apparition is a good Alc counter since Ice Blast cancels the massive HP regen bonus he gets from
				Chemical Rage.</li>
