		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Wave of Terror is a useful spell for scouting out dangerous territory because of its massive
				range+vision.</li>
			<li>Wave of Terror affects spell immune units and Roshan. It can also disable clarities and salves.</li>
			<li>Vengeance Aura only amplifies base damage and damage from attribute items, not +damage items.</li>
			<li>Vlad's can be a worthwhile pickup on VS, because if you're standing around your carry, you'll be giving
				them +51% bonus damage with both Vengeance+Vladmir's Aura.</li>
			<li>Nether Swap goes through spell immunity.</li>
			<li>If you're ever against an Enigma, your assignment is to sit around and play with your hair until you can
				use Swap to break Black Hole.</li>
			<li>Glimmer Cape can be a powerful pickup on VS since you can invisibly get into position to Swap, Swap a
				hero, and then fade out again.</li>
			<li>Aether Lens effectively boosts Nether Swap's range to the next skill point level.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Wave of Terror is basically an AoE Medallion once maxed. This means that it's very easy for VS's team to
				take Rosh early and it means that tower diving a VS can be very dangerous.</li>
			<li>When you're 20 minutes in on a terrible game and you're trying to make yourself feel better by asking,
				"Who has the better late game?" The answer is typically the team with VS on it. Vengeance Aura gets
				stronger as (most) carries get stronger. End soon against a VS before she starts beefing up her carries
				or turns into one herself.</li>
			<li>If you're a support and you got the kill credit on VS during a team fight, that means that you have the
				negative Vengeance Aura on you. If you're not contributing much to what your team does next (like
				pushing a tower), stay away from your team.</li>
			<li>At level 16, Nether Swap's range is 1200, which is dangerously long. During T3 tower defenses, make sure
				that the enemy team doesn't have wards on your high ground otherwise your carry is going to get swapped.</li>
		</ul>
