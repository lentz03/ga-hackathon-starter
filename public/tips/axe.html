		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Berserker's Call goes through spell immunity. If you see a BKB'd Shadow Fiend having an epileptic fit
				while he's casting his ult, walk up and Q him.</li>
			<li>Just because you don't catch anyone in Berserker's Call doesn't mean the spell was a bust. You get +40
				armor during its duration which can easily make the difference between life and death early game during
				tower dives.</li>
			<li>Berserker's Call is a handy way to break an enemy's invisibility. If an enemy Clinkz just ran away with
				10 HP, try Blinking into where you think he'll be and cast Call. If you're right, they'll be forced to
				attack you and lose their invis.</li>
			<li>Remember that you can draw aggro from creeps on demand by right clicking enemy heroes. Even if the enemy
				hero is across the map, right clicking them will draw creep aggro. Don't waste mana on Call if you don't
				have to.</li>
			<li>Battle Hunger is a great spell for disabling Blink Daggers, especially when breaking high ground.</li>
			<li>When jungling a camp with Satyrs, draw aggro back a bit so that the tiny ranged Satyrs aren't getting
				hit by Counter Helix. They give you extra chances to Helix at the cost of practically no damage, but
				they'll usually die first if you keep them in Helix range.</li>
			<li>You can Cull any enemy unit, including creeps. While this is usually irrelevant, it can be worth Culling
				a creep to get the massive 40% AoE movement speed buff to catch up to an enemy.</li>
			<li>You can instagib flying or walking couriers at any level of Culling Blade since couriers are always
				below the damage threshold.</li>
			<li>Leave your Tranquil Boots on the ground while jungling and then pick them up once you finish a camp to
				immediately get the regen without waiting for the damage cooldown. Just be sure there aren't any stealth
				heroes around to steal them.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Battle Hunger can be taken off by denies. If your lane mate is being a hungry hungry hippo with last
				hits, focus your energy on landing a deny.</li>
			<li>Pay attention to who is Battle Hungered late game. Let poor old Witch Doctor get a last hit instead of
				having him take unnecessary damage.</li>
			<li>When trying to help an ally who is about to die to Axe in lane, <i>don't</i> toss a few measly auto attacks if Axe isn't close to death himself. Axe will gladly trade some damage if it means he gets a few more chances to Helix.</li>
			<li>Culling Blade can kill through Dazzle's Shallow Grave and Oracle's False Promise. It can also kill Rosh. Culling Blade don't care.</li>
