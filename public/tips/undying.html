		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Decay is weird nuke. You take STR+the nuke damage from a hero on every cast, but it doesn't
				look like much because their HP bar is still full green. After you play Dirge for a couple of games, you
				realize that enemies will often fail to notice how much HP they're missing in lane and how much damage
				you've built up. So crank the aggression.</li>
			<li>In lane, try to use Decay only when you can catch multiple heroes. The people you are laning against are
				not drift compatible. Even if they're doing a good job avoiding each other, they'll eventually bumble
				into each other, which is when you pounce.</li>
			<li>Try to use healing items only when you don't have Decay stacks on. Since Decay gives you more STR,
				you're healing a lower percentage of actual health when you eat a tango.</li>
			<li>Soul Rip is technically more useful as a heal than a nuke because healing isn't reduced by magic
				resistance.</li>
			<li>You can Soul Rip your Tombstone to heal it. In 90% of team fights this is how you should be using the
				spell.</li>
			<li>If you're getting ganked, use Soul Rip before spamming Decay. Decay increases your STR, but Soul Rip
				only heals a flat amount of HP. You'll heal a larger portion of your max HP if you use Soul Rip first
				and then steal strength.</li>
			<li>Zombies add to Soul Rip's unit count.</li>
			<li>"Oh good, Flesh Golem is down, let's force a fight," said no team ever. Tombstone is your real ult, so
				use it carefully. The fight needs to get nice and committed before you should feel comfortable bringing
				the thriller, so don't initiate with it. The zombie spawning AoE may feel like a lot in the laning
				phase, but when team fights start rolling around, people will escape the zombie spawn radius without
				even trying if you plop down the Tombstone on reflex.</li>
			<li>If you're trying to use Tombstone as a slow, you're pretty desperate. If you're that desperate, the
				enemy has probably been running for a while. If the enemy has been running for a while, their teammates
				are probably en route. If their teammates force a fight, you have no Tombstone. Don't use Tombstone as a
				last ditch slow. However, it can be useful if you need vision since zombies have 1400 day and night
				vision for some reason.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Don't stand next to your lane partner when you're against Undying, especially in a trilane. If he's
				spamming Decay, make sure he's only hitting one hero.</li>
			<li>Because Undying takes your STR in lane, healing items are more effective. If you've got a few stacks of
				Decay on yourself, that's the best time to use a tango.</li>
			<li>Gyro's Flak Cannon and Ember's Sleight of Fist are the only spells capable of committing mass zombie
				genocide.</li>
			<li>Kill the Tombstone. Finish it. I don't want this
				toss-one-attack-meh-I-didn't-do-much-damage-to-it-so-it's-not-my-problem business, or this
				well-we-almost-killed-it-but-then-it-got-Soul-Ripped-so-whatevs garbage. Unless your team has one of the
				aforementioned methods of zombie genocide it is almost ALWAYS worth killing the Tombstone the second it
				comes up. Even if you're faring okay as the carry, your support players fending for dear life if you
				don't help them.</li>
			<li>Elder Titan's Astral Spirit gets damage and movespeed for every zombie it hits.</li>
			<li>Mjollnir is a fairly good pickup against Undying since zombies constantly hitting you will help Static
				Shield proc more frequently. The lightning(s) won't kill zombies, though.</li>
			<li>Crimson Guard effectively neutralizes all zombie damage for 10 seconds.</li>
			<li>Stout/Poor Man's Shield can also be used to block zombie damage.</li>
			<li>Zombies will lose interest in you if you go invisible.</li>
			<li>Zombies don't break Urn of Shadows healing.</li>
			<li>You can see how much time is left on the Tombstone by clicking on it and watching its 'Spell Immunity'
				buff run down.</li>
			<li>Flesh Golem's damage amplification is vastly underestimated. Undying isn't just being a nuisance
				stomping around your carry, he's being a walking Soul Catcher. You don't have to kill him right off the
				bat, but keep him off of your high priority allies.</li>
