		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>If you've got nothing better to do early game as Chen, try finding a Wildwing and just send it mid.
				Start a Tornado and sic it on the enemy mid. Alternatively, find a Harpy and constantly cast Chain
				Lightning on the enemy mid. Congratulations, you just won mid lane.</li>
			<li>Don't bring your whole entourage back to base if you need to refill HP and mana. Leave your creeps in
				the lane and try to pick up last hits, or send them to jungle/ancient camps and start stacking.</li>
			<li>The net on the Dark Troll Warlord goes through spell immunity and Linken's Sphere.</li>
			<li>When you lose control of a Mud Golem, it will instantly split, but you will still have control of the Shards.
				Early game you can use this to stun an enemy with the Mud Golem, Persuade a lane creep to force the split, and
				then have two more Shard Golem stuns.</li>
			<li>Agh allows you to control 3 Ancients, but you're still allowed 4 creeps total. Don't forget about
				alpha wolves and Kobolds and other useful aura creeps after you amass an ancient army.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Consider getting a Midas or Helm of the Dominator if you're up against a Chen. Watch him fumble through
				his control groups before he realizes that you turned his Satyr into your Ogre Club.</li>
			<li>Heroes with spells that notably affect creeps are big counters against Chen. Crystal Maiden's Frostbite,
				Witch Doctor's Paralyzing Cask, Lifestealer's Infest, and Clinkz's Death Pact are a few specific
				examples.</li>
