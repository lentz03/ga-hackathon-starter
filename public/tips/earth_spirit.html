		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You can Boulder Smash allies out of Chronosphere (post-Agh Grip doesn't work, though).</li>
			<li>You can drop a Remnant while you're revving up in Rolling Boulder.</li>
			<li>You can double tap the Remnant hotkey to automatically drop one in front of yourself.</li>
			<li>You can use items while Rolling (except Blink). This is mainly useful for TPs, Shiva's,
				Sheepstick/Orchid, and wards. If you use a Force Staff while it's revving up, you'll get the Force and
				continue rolling. If you use Force while rolling, you'll get the Force but the Boulder will break apart.</li>
			<li>You can pick up runes while Rolling.</li>
			<li>You can use/target spells while you're in your Boulder. This means that you can Smash an ally while
				you're rolling into them or do a drive-by Gripping.</li>
			<li>When you hit an enemy hero with Rolling Boulder you'll always appear behind them and at the same angle
				from which you approached them. You can target your Smash on them while Rolling and you'll immediately
				kick them back along the path you came.</li>
			<li>Rolling Boulder destroys trees along the path that you roll.</li>
			<li>Neither Smash nor Grip can interrupt ally or enemy channels when directly targeted on the hero.</li>
			<li>Reduce, reuse, recycle. Use the same Remnant you just Gripped to Roll into. Smash a Remnant into an
				enemy then spam Grip to catch it while it's still moving.</li>
			<li>The disadvantage of recycling is that you end up stacking your total disables on top of each other (some
				of the silence duration is wasted because the enemy is stunned anyway). If you have Remnants to burn,
				stagger your spells.</li>
			<li>The trickiest part about using Magnetize effectively is getting it started. The initial Magnetize radius
				is a tiny AoE around Earth Spirit himself. But once you get it cracking on one unit, then the good times
				can start to roll. Use Force Staff or Boulder Smash to manipulate the Magnetized unit's position to get
				closer to other heroes, then cast a Remnant near it.</li>
			<li>The trigger radius on a Remnant from a magnetized unit is larger than the activation/refresh radius to
				Magnetize new enemies, so place fresh Remnants closer to un-Magnetized enemies.</li>
			<li>The Magnetize DoT lasts for 6 seconds on an enemy. Space out re-Magnetizations to squeeze out the most
				damage.</li>
			<li>Rolling into an Enchant Remnant (Agh skill) will immediately take the hero out of Remnant form.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Kaolin Showdown isn't invulnerable inside the Rolling Boulder. He's fully targeted and can be stunned
				and damaged as per usual.</li>
			<li>When ganking an Earth Spirit, stand in front of his Rolling Boulder and make him hit you to prevent him
				from rolling out of the situation.</li>
			<li>Earth Spirit needs a lot of time to recharge Remnants after a teamfight. Keep high aggression when
				playing against an Earth Spirit.</li>
			<li>Magnetize deals some substantial amounts of hurt. Don't stand next to your team if you're Magnetized and
				they're not.</li>
			<li>Magnetize can be dispelled.</li>
