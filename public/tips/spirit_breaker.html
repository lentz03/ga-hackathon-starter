		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Take advantage of the proximity Greater Bashes you are gifted while Charging. If you're trying to land a
				stun on a target that can't be targeted (cycloned, spell immune, banished, etc.) line yourself up so that
				you can target a unit behind your actual target and bash them en route.</li>
			<li>You can use items while you're Charging, like Shadow Blade, Mask of Madness, or BKB. You can even
				TPÂ while you're charging, but only to the fountain and only if you double click the TP.</li>
			<li>You can also tread swap while Charging. So switch to INT treads before casting and turn back to STR
				treads while you're charging.</li>
			<li>Empowering Haste is a useful active spell. Please don't forget to use it.</li>
			<li>If you're getting ganked and you can't take the fight, immediately move your camera over to another
				lane, find a creep or neutral, and Charge it. This is your escape mechanism.</li>
			<li>Greater Bash is essentially a crit dressed up in a scaling bash. Unfortunately, the only way of
				amplifying the 'crit' damage is by building move speed, not damage. The plus side is that you have two
				guaranteed ways of proccing this crit Bash with Charge and Nether Strike. At 522 move speed, a level 4
				Greater Bash deals ~209 magical damage. This would make the Charge+Nether Strike combo deal ~667 magical
				damage at level 11.</li>
			<li>You can Nether Strike the enemy courier. It won't deal any damage, but you will bash it.</li>
			<li>Probably the best Dust carrier and anti-invis hero you could ask for in pubs. Every time Dust is off
				cooldown, Charge that Riki and bash him into next Tuesday.</li>
			<li>Get wards in the enemy jungle. Players will automatically avoid farming in lane once they realize you're
				becoming a threat and will start farming their jungle. Teach them that there is no sanctuary from the
				space cow.</li>
			<li>SB is the tankiest level 1 hero in the game. With no items, the cosmic bull has an EHP of ~927. Take
				advantage of your chuftiness and don't be afraid of getting into fights early on.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ward everywhere. You need to always be keeping tabs on Spirit Breaker: Where does he come from, where
				does he go, who is he ganking, Barathrum Joe.</li>
			<li>Even though most Spirit Breakers will carry dust, consider getting a Glimmer Cape if he's charging
				often. Nearly all of SB's damage is magical and needs to be dealt quickly, so the buffed magic
				resistance while Glimmered will defray a lot of the damage.</li>
			<li>Charge can break Linken's from across the map. In bronze scum pubs this makes Linken's an SB counter,
				but in RIAA-certified Double Platinum tier, this makes SB a Linken's counter.</li>
			<li>One of the easiest heroes to bait. No SB can resist charging down a lonely CM quietly farming in lane,
				so take advantage of the mad cow's blood thirst. After a few failed ganks, the map will open up
				substantially when he stops Charging on a whim.</li>
			<li>You can stun SB while he's charging. This is useful to know when you're getting Charged, but it's also
				useful when you're ganking SB. Keep a stun in your pocket for when he tries to Charge to another lane.</li>
			<li>You can disable SB while he's in the middle of the cast animation for Nether Strike.</li>
