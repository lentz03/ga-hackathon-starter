		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Use Waveform to travel between and damage two jungle camps at the same time.</li>
			<li>Waveform can be used to absorb certain projectiles headfirst since you are invincible during the
				spell.</li>
			<li>When using Waveform to push the lane, move near the ranged creep in the enemy wave and Waveform in
				towards your creeps or into trees. You make yourself vulnerable to ganks if you Waveform deeper into
				enemy territory.</li>
			<li>You can toggle Morph STR/AGI while stunned/disabled (not during a Silence, though).</li>
			<li>Replicate has a surprisingly high cast range. Use this not only to make Replicas of enemies from far away
				during team fights, but as a gap closer during ganks (create a Replica, immediately take its position,
				you are now in your target) or as an escape when getting ganked.</li>
			<li>When using a Replica to escape, treat it like an Illusory Orb. Let your hero walk in one direction and
				let the Replica go the opposite direction. Doesn't matter which one the enemies commit to, you're gold
				ponyboy.</li>
			<li>If you're farming the jungle and you've got nothing better to do, micro your Replicate. Besides letting
				it get last hits for you, you can try sending it into enemy territory to bait out some ultimates.</li>
			<li>Replicas deal 80% damage. An 80% damage Agh Tiny still hurts like crazy, whether he's the enemy or your
				ally. Find the highest damage dealer in the map and Replicate them for a team fight. Replicas also take
				100% damage. A 100% HP Centaur takes an eternity to kill. If the highest damage dealer in the map is
				also someone who gets iced out in moments (i.e. Clinkz), then try to go for the tankiest.</li>
			<li>Other good targets for Replication are heroes who have good passives or auras which carry over to
				illusions: Axe for Counter Helix, Phantom Lancer for your own personal PL army, Spectre for Desolate,
				Riki for Permanent Invisibility, and heroes who have a Radiance.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>You need to have nukes if you want to kill Morph. With STR Morph, he can usually gain HP before you can
				burn him down with auto attacks.</li>
			<li>You can see how much time Morphling has left on a Replicate illusion by checking his buff timer. Time your
				ganks when it's about to end.</li>
			<li>Be wary of committing fully to out of position heroes when there's a Morphling on the enemy team. It's
				highly likely that it's a Replicate.</li>
			<li>If Morph went E-Blade, he's probably roaming around with low strength, making him a prime candidate for
				a good old fashioned Nyxing. Good Nyxers include: Nyx, Nyx, Nyx, Io+Anyone, Nyx, and Dagon 5 +
				Sheepstick Tinker or Furion.</li>
