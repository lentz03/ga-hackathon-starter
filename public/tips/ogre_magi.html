		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ogre can trade hits with the best of them in lane. Dude has ridiculous starting armor and a bucket of HP to
				boot. To give perspective, he has more EHP at spawn than a level 6 Crystal Maiden. Plus, he has 3.5HP/s passive
				regen JUST CAUSE. Love the chuft, fear the chuft.</li>
			<li>At max Multicast, the range on Ignite is nearly the same as Blink Dagger range. This can be a really
				simple way to turn off an initiator's Blink Dagger forÂ ~10 seconds.</li>
			<li>An early level in Bloodlust can be a big deal. 10% movement speed can very easily turn around or secure
				a gank.</li>
			<li>You can cast Bloodlust on towers.</li>
			<li>Once you're level 16, you should be butter churning Bloodlust into every allied unit on the map if you
				have the mana. Heroes, creeps, Spirit Bear, siege creeps... Beastmaster's Hawk?</li>
			<li>The courier can also be given the lust for Blood.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Even though running's not as fun as hitting, Ogre is a chaser extraordinaire. His only downfall is his
				slow cast times. If Ogre's chasing you down, try running into fog from trees often.</li>
