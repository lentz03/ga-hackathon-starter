		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Gush's side effect is armor reduction. Try to use it before Anchor Smash since Anchor Smash is physical
				damage.</li>
			<li>Since Anchor Smash deals physical damage, you can use it to kill ancient creeps.</li>
			<li>Anchor Smash is an extremely easy spell to animation cancel (hit the stop key). This is mainly relevant
				if you're laning against another melee hero since you can bait them out of getting last hits by throwing
				out half-Smashes.</li>
			<li>The damage reduction on Anchor Smash can be applied through spell immunity. Meaning that if you're
				dealing with BKB carries, save your post-Ravage Anchor Smash after BKBs are turned on. If you apply it
				before they go spell immune, BKB will purge the debuff off.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Ravage has a travel time as it expands outward, so if you're quick, you can attempt Force Staffing or
				using some other repositioning spell/item to evade it.</li>
		</ul>
