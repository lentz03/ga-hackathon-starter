		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Blink into the trees! If you're getting ganked, always assume that there is someone behind you, waiting
				for you to blink back into the lane/jungle to retreat. You have a stupid low cooldown on blink. Blink
				into the trees, watch four heroes suddenly materialize from the fog struggling to find you, then quietly
				blink along the treeline until you're sure you're safe.</li>
			<li>Left click on an enemy hero to check their mana pool before Mana Voiding them. You may even be able to
				get a kill without doing any right clicking if you show up at the right time.</li>
			<li>Mana Void comes with a free ministun that penetrates spell immunity. Don't keep slicing at people if you
				see them channeling something, just cancel it.</li>
			<li>Even if the primary target is spell immune, Mana Void area damage still works. If Storm Spirit burns
				himself dry and then BKBs to walk out, he's still a good target if he walks near his team.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Shadow Demon is a notable counter against AM since the illusions created by Disruption will mana burn
				him.</li>
			<li>Try not to stack disables when ganking AM. Stuns and silences are invaluable when you're trying to kill
				him, but you need to stagger them appropriately otherwise he'll blink out.</li>
			<li>A Ghost Scepter can save your life if you're a support and the fun is over.</li>
