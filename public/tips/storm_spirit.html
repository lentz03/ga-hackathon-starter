		<h1>Tips</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Static Remnants give you flying vision in a fairly large radius around their cast point. Use this to
				find people trying to juke in the trees, scout Rosh, or check an area before going up hill.</li>
			<li>Remnants last 12 seconds each so it's not a bad idea to set some up if you're afraid a Nyx or Bounty is
				trailing you since they'll detonate and damage on invis units.</li>
			<li>You can drop a Static Remnant on an Aegis carrier's tombstone to prevent them from blinking out since
				the Remnant will detonate as soon as the enemy respawns.</li>
			<li>Only Electric Vortex levels 3 and 4 will pull a target far enough into a Remnant that you create after
				you Vortex. Levels 1 and 2 will just wiggle them down a bit while you waste mana and slow yourself down.</li>
			<li>You can Overload an auto attack while it's in the air. If you just tossed a long range auto attack on a
				target, you can cast a Remnant or Ball real quick and the attack will hit Overloaded.</li>
			<li>Cast a spell in the fountain or throw up a quick Remnant once you reach your destination if you're going
				to be TPing to a tower. Or use a spell before activating an invis rune. Get your free Overload.</li>
			<li>You can use items while in Ball Lightning, like Orchid. You can begin channeling a TP while flying. You
				can cast spells like Remnant or Electric Vortex while flying. You can even pick up runes that are along
				your path while in Ball Lightning.</li>
			<li>Since you're also invulnerable in Ball Lightning, try using Bottle charges while zipping to offset the
				mana cost of traveling with no risk of the regen falling off.</li>
			<li>Storm will immediately perform the next action you ordered once you come out of Ball Lightning (if you
				have auto-attack after spell enabled in your settings). If there is no action (like a right click on the
				enemy hero), he'll just auto attack the nearest thing. This can be irritating when you're Balling long
				distances or into fogged vision because he'll inevitably blow an Overload charge on a creep. To avoid
				this, hit the stop key while you're flying and he'll do nothing when he lands.</li>
			<li>Avoid making multiple short trips when you're escaping and Balling on a mana budget. Do one long trip.
				There's no reason to have to pay the ignition cost of Ball Lightning multiple times if you have one
				destination.</li>
			<li>You are completely invincible while in Ball Lightning, so brush up on your jukenomics. Besides using the
				invincibility to dodge things, spells like Mana Leak or Rupture won't affect you when you're traveling
				and you can even fly through a Chronosphere without getting locked.</li>
			<li>You can cast a 0 range Ball Lightning by clicking your hero portrait when targeting Ball.</li>
			<li>A lot of people shoehorn themselves into always building mana regeneration on Storm. It's okay to build
				yourself around mana optimization, rather than regeneration, if that's your playstyle. Boots of Travel
				can be a good pickup since TPing to a creep can halve the Ball distance to an enemy instead of TPing to
				a tower. BKB allows you to stand in a fight and lets you use Ball Lightning exclusively to get Overload
				charges. Even Shadow Blade, while clowny, can allow you to initiate with a straight Backstab -> Vortex,
				letting you keep Ball mana in the bank for when you need to escape or chase enemies down.</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Counters</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Shut his mouth. Silences and basically every disable really rumble Storm's jonathans. The more time he
				has to spend walking around with Underloaded right clicking, the less happy he is.</li>
			<li>Break his ankles. Like most other heroes with a blink, Storms will overshoot Ball Lightning down the
				path that they think you're traveling so they can get in more right clicks. If you're escaping out of
				his auto attack range during a gank, as soon as he starts Balling towards you, turn around and move to
				where he just was. He'll either have to Ball again or slowly walk to come back.</li>
			<li>Ghost Scepter is an underrated item against Storm. Yes, most of his damage is magic, but he actually has
				to right click on you to deal it.</li>
